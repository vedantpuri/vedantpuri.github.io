  desc: Welcome to a glimpse of my journey so far. At 20 years of age, studying computer science, I am an NLP enthusiast with a slight inclination towards cyber-security. After taking off my blinkers of just focussing on coursework, I have expanded my horizon by delving into the beautiful wonderland of developing side projects and using my knowledge so far to build something productive. If you have an out of the box idea and need help in executing it, sign me up for it! Apart from the nitty gritties of my portfolio that I mentioned below for the purpose of looking for an internship this summer, I am a huge soccer fan, having played several tournaments at various levels, MCFC being my favorite team. Also, I love listening to music and I workout occaisonally. # Describe yourself.
